This is a personal implementation of the Atari Net as introduced by DeepMind (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1312.5602).<br>
Instead of using the various options present in the gym libraries (https://www.gymlibrary.dev/), I tried to implement all the features necessary for learning a Qnet.<br>

A match of a trained network can be seen here<br>
